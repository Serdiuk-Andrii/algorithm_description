\section{Problem statement}
\subsection{Formulation 0: Vertex only, oracle} 
Given a pedigree, represented as a directed acyclic graph $P = \{\mathcal{H},\mathcal{F}\},$ where $\mathcal{H}$ are haploid individuals or ploids (vertices in the graph) and $F$ are genealogical filiations (edges in the graph), and a gene (coalescent) tree $C = \{\mathcal{V}(C),\mathcal{E}(C)\}$ that is `extracted' from $P$ find a mapping from $M:V(C) \rightarrow H$ such that       

\subsection{Formulation 1: Vertex only} 

\begin{definition}
	In a directed graph $D$, a vertex $v \in V(D)$ is a descendant of a vertex $u \in V(D)$ if there exists a simple directed path $ua_1 \ldots a_nv$.
\end{definition}

By $\desc(v)$, let's denote the set of all the descendants of $v$.

\begin{definition}
	
	Let $D$ be a directed graph and $A = a_1, \ldots, a_n$ be a set of vertices in $V(D)$. A vertex $v \in V(D)$ is said to a genealogical common ancestor of $A$ if:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 
		$A \subset \desc(v),$
		\item 
		$\forall u \in \desc(v): A \not \subset \desc(u).$
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{definition}

Given a pedigree, represented as a directed acyclic graph $P = \{\mathcal{H},\mathcal{F}\},$ where $\mathcal{H}$ are haploid individuals or ploids (vertices in the graph) and $F$ are genealogical filiations (edges in the graph), and a gene (coalescent) tree $C = \{\mathcal{V}(C),\mathcal{E}(C)\}$ that is `extracted' from $P$ find a mapping from $M:V(C) \rightarrow H$ such that 
$\forall u \in V(C)$ with $N_C(u) \ne \emptyset$ it holds that $M(u)$ is a genealogical common ancestor of $M(N_C(u))$.

\subsection{Formulation 2: Vertex-only with path-specific output}

		
\section{Preprocessing step}

The preprocessing step consists of three steps:

\subsection{Reading the pedigree}

During this step, we simply read the pedigree from a file and save the information about the graph. The time complexity of this step is $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph.

\subsection{Calculating the levels and descendants lists from the probands}

Next, we calculate the levels of the graph and the descendant list for every vertex in the graph. Every vertex has to know its descendants because we need this information to discard graphical common ancestors that are not genealogical common ancestors later in the algorithm.

Generally speaking, having descendants for every vertex can require a lot of memory. According to my calculations, we should still be able to store it for large graphs. There are different more complicated approaches that can take a little bit more time but save a lot of memory. Since the preprocessing step is done only once, we can afford to spend more time during this step to lower the memory requirements.

In the "path aware" approach, the descendant list also stores the path to every descendant.

\subsection{Preprocessing the common ancestors map}

Starting with the founders (whose map entries has been already calculated), the algorithm fills the common ancestors map for all the other vertices going level by level.

\subsection{Result}

In the end, we have a three-dimensional matrix (a dictionary of dictionaries of dictionaries) that returns a common ancestry object for a triple (a, b, c) where c is a common ancestor of a and b.

The common ancestry object contains all the paths by which a and b can reach c.

\begin{lstlisting}

class PathCommonAncestry:
	
	def __init__(self, common_ancestor: int,
		first_vertex: int, second_vertex: int,
		first_vertex_paths: [Path],
		second_vertex_paths: [Path]):
		self.common_ancestor = common_ancestor
		self.first_vertex = first_vertex
		self.second_vertex = second_vertex
		self.first_vertex_paths = first_vertex_paths
		self.second_vertex_paths = second_vertex_paths

\section{Alignment}

\vspace*{-\baselineskip}

\begin{lstlisting}

class PathAligner:

def align():
# Get current partial mapping
partial_mapping = get_partial_mapping()
iterator = get_vertex_iterator()
while not iterator.finished():
	# Vertex in the coalescence tree that has not been mapped
	vertex_to_map = iterator.next()
	# Get the candidates for the vertex. If vertex_to_map has only
	# one child (no coalescence), return None
	candidates = get_candidates_for_vertex(vertex_to_map)
	if candidates is None:
		partial_mapping[vertex_to_map] = None
		continue
	result = []
	for candidate in candidates:
		if verify_assignment(vertex_to_map, candidate):
			result.append(candidate)
	# If there are no candidates whose assignment are consistent,
	# trace back to the previous decision
	if not result:
		return None			
	while length(result) > 0:
		candidate_to_try = result.pop()
		aligner = PathAligner(self)
		alignment_result = aligner.align()
		if alignment_result is not None:
			return alignment_result
	# None of the assignment worked, return None
	return None
